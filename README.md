<b>Objective:</b>
Build, train, evaluate, and deploy a deep learning model for classification or regression using PyTorch. 

<b>Dataset chosen:</b> MNIST

<b>Step 1:</b> Loading and normalising the dataset
</br><b>Step 2:</b> Creating a deep learning model using fully connected and convolutional layers
</br><b>Step 3:</b> Training and optimising the model (with plots of training and test losses and accuracy score)
</br><b>Step 4:</b> Saving the model
</br><b>Step 5:</b> Creating the confusion matrix to better understand the accuracy of the model
</br><b>Step 6:</b> Predicting labels for unseen images
