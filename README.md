Objective:
Build, train, evaluate, and deploy a deep learning model for classification or regression using PyTorch. 

Dataset chosen: MNIST

Step 1: Loading and normalising the dataset
Step 2: Creating a deep learning model using fully connected and convolutional layers
Step 3: Training and optimising the model (with plots of training and test losses and accuracy score)
Step 4: Saving the model
Step 5: Creating the confusion matrix to better understand the accuracy of the model
Step 6: Predicting labels for unseen images
